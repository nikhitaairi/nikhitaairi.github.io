## Bio

I am a researcher at the [Tax Policy Center](#0) at the Urban Institute. I work on microsimulation modeling, quantitative analysis, and data visualization, focusing on refundable tax credits for low-income families and children, and the interplay between federal, state, and local tax and budget policy. Most of all I'm excited about blending subject matter knowledge and code-first data science methods to build better tools and workflows for tax researchers.

## Experience

**Urban Institute** \| Research associate, previous roles \| July 2019 - Present
