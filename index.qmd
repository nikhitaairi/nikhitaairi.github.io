I am a researcher at the [Tax Policy Center](https://taxpolicycenter.org) at the Urban Institute.

I work on microsimulation modeling, quantitative analysis, and data visualization, focusing on refundable tax credits for low-income families and children, and the interplay between federal, state, and local tax and budget policy.

I'm excited about blending subject matter knowledge and code-first data science methods to build better tools and workflows for tax researchers.

Outside of work I can be found geeking out about public transit or at a movie theater.
